AI-powered auto s is one of the most undervalued technologies in the software engineering field. While traditional auto scaling systems rely on pre-defined rules and thresholds, AI-powered systems use machine learning algorithms to dynamically adapt to changing workloads.

The benefits of AI-powered auto scaling compared to traditional methods are numerous. For one, it allows for more accurate predictions of resource usage and can reduce the number of unnecessary scale-outs. This not only improves the efficiency of resource utilization but also reduces costs for the company.

Additionally, AI-powered auto scaling can handle non-linear and non-stationary workloads, which traditional methods struggle to handle. It also can take into account various features of the system state, like CPU and memory usage, network traffic and more, to make more accurate predictions on when and how to scale.

Moreover, AI-powered auto scaling can learn and adjust to the specific patterns of your system over time. It can become more accurate and efficient as it processes more data, allowing for even more cost savings in the long run.

In conclusion, AI-powered auto scaling is an undervalued technology that offers numerous benefits over traditional auto scaling systems. Companies that are looking to improve the efficiency
